    Creating the Wordle-like app posed some real challenges, especially for us beginners. The toughest part was getting the game logic right â€“ making sure we could tell players if their guesses were spot-on, close, or off the mark. Designing a user-friendly interface that worked well on different devices was another big task, especially when we added the keyboard for players to use. A tricky part was making sure the game remembered where players were if they closed their browser. To do this, we had to learn how to save the game's progress using something called local storage, which was a bit complex because it involved understanding how React handles data and changes in the app.
    If given more time, two exciting updates we'd love to add to our Wordle game would be Multiplayer Mode and Mobile Responsiveness. The Multiplayer Mode would allow players to challenge their friends in real-time, making the game even more engaging and competitive. Additionally, making the game fully optimized for mobile devices is essential. This means ensuring that the game looks great and works smoothly on phones and tablets, which would make it accessible to a much broader audience who prefer to play on their mobile devices. 
    While developing the project, we assumed that most users would already know how to play Wordle and wouldn't need much instructions for them to get started.We also thought that they would mostly play the game on a desktop browser instead of on mobile phones too.
    Overall, thie project took us about 15 hours from planning to implemnting and initial testing and debugging.
